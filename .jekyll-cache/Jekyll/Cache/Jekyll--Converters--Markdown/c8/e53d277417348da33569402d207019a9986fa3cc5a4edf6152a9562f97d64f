<p>In this post we just make a general description of the set of partial differential equations that govern the fluid dynamics in space.</p>

<h2 id="system-of-equations">System of equations</h2>

<p>Here we write the equations that describe a <em>compressible</em>, <em>unsteady</em>, and <em>viscous</em> flow.</p>

<p>Compressibility shows up in the equations as an explicit dependence of density on space and time, and real effects of this might appear depending on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_number">Mach number</a>. Unsteadyness is the time dependence of the unknowns in the equations. And viscosity refers in the equations to the viscous stress tensor \(\tau\).</p>

<h2 id="derivation">Derivation</h2>

<p>The 3D Navier-Stokes equations follow from expressing the conservation of <strong>mass</strong>, <strong>momentum</strong>,and <strong>energy</strong> in a differential form. Normally, the expression of the conservation of a quantity \(\alpha\).</p>
