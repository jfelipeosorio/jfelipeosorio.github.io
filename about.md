Hey this is Felipe! I was born in Colombia where I first got a BSc in Mathematics from the [Department of Mathematics at Escuela Colombiana de Ingenier√≠a Julio Garavito](https://www.escuelaing.edu.co/es/programas/matematicas/) , then I got a second BSc in Statistics from the [Department of Statistics at Universidad Nacional de Colombia](http://ciencias.bogota.unal.edu.co/departamentos/departamento-de-estadistica/el-departamento/). Currently, I'm a student of the MSc in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the [Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington](https://amath.washington.edu/).
