In [Part 1]({% post_url 2021-12-22-Part1_DMKDE %}) we checked at the most important mathematical and statistical concepts that could allow us to talk about Kernel Density Estimation using Density Matrices. In Part 2, we would like to understand how to use the algorithm already implemented [here](https://github.com/fagonzalezo/qmc) by Professor [Fabio Gonzalez](https://dis.unal.edu.co/~fgonza/) and its research group [MindLab](http://www.ingenieria.unal.edu.co/mindlab/) using custom layers and models in [TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/). 


## Install `qmc` 

LetÂ´s install (git clone to the file system of the Colab VM) the module `qmc` which contains
> Custom models inherited from the super class `tf.keras.Model`.

> Custom layers inherited from the super class `tf.keras.layers.Layer`.

More information on customization when using `tf` this can be found at [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/custom_layers#models_composing_layers).


```python
# Install qmc if running in Google Colab
try:
  import google.colab
  IN_COLAB = True
except:
  IN_COLAB = False

if IN_COLAB:
    !rm -R qmc qmc1
    !git clone https://github.com/fagonzalezo/qmc.git
    !mv qmc qmc1
    !mv qmc1/qmc .
else:
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, "../")
```
